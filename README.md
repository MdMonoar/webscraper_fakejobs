# Web Scraping Fakejobs
This is a webscraping script using python. This is my practice script after reading a realpython tutorial titled 'Beautiful Soup: Build a Web Scraper With Python'. 
<br><br>

## It does:
The script scrapes job data (title, company, location, email address and company website link) from a fake jobsite - [The Free Python Job Board](https://pythonjobs.github.io/).
The site is a static website. The data is converted and saved into an excel file(.xlsx format). There is an excel file in the repository that was made by the script.
Take a look at the sample image [here]()

## Why?
The script can be used to collect data from any static website.


## How?
I have used [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for scraping web data. Pandas and openpyxl was used to convert and save the data into an 
excel file. There is a 'requirements.txt' file in the repository. It contains all the necessary modules and their version that were used. These are necessary for 
the script to run. One can install the modules and check the script.

## Where?
The script was inspired from the tutorial [Beautiful Soup: Build a Web Scraper With Python](https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/).
 The tutorial was very beginner friendly.
 Also [BeautifulSoup4 documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) was used for reference.
 Feel free to ask me for any help with this project. Any suggestions and advices are appreciated.

## Who?
The script was written all by me. I tried to comment it part by part. Nobody is perfect. Any comments or criticisms are welcome.
